/**
 * Keeps Pi's raw-message numbering in the coordinate space the session's
 * stored state was written in.
 *
 * Every ordinal Magic Context stores for a Pi session (compartment ranges,
 * the search-index watermark, note anchors, compression depth, pending
 * compaction markers) is a position in the raw-message list numbered by
 * walking `sessionManager.getBranch()` from its first entry. That list can
 * lose entries in front of everything stored: `getBranch()` walks parent
 * links from the leaf and stops at the first parent it cannot find, so when
 * Pi's loader drops an unparseable JSONL line (it skips malformed lines),
 * every entry before the break disappears from the walk. The stored ordinals
 * then run ahead of the branch numbering. The newest compartment's end sits
 * past the branch's last ordinal, so the historian sees "no new raw history"
 * on every pass and never runs again.
 *
 * The stored rows also name their boundary messages by id, so the offset is
 * measured rather than guessed. Locate the newest compartment's end message on
 * the branch; offset = stored ordinal - branch ordinal. Readers then number
 * the branch from offset + 1, behind empty slots for the ordinals the walk no
 * longer reaches, and every stored coordinate keeps its meaning without a
 * single row being rewritten.
 *
 * The offset is derived from the stored rows and the branch on every pass
 * rather than saved: a saved copy is a second source of truth that could
 * disagree with the rows it was derived from. Appending to the branch never
 * changes it. A `/tree` jump to a point before the anchor removes the anchor
 * from the branch, and a chain that heals makes the offset 0 again; both are
 * picked up by the next derivation.
 *
 * Safety rules:
 * - The newest compartment's end message missing from the branch, or a second
 *   stored anchor that implies a different offset, means the stored ordinals
 *   cannot be placed: the session is `unanchored`. The historian and the
 *   native compaction marker stay paused for it, and readers keep plain branch
 *   numbering, which is what they did before this module existed.
 * - When the stored anchors cannot even be read (a failed query), the session
 *   is `unresolved`: the same pauses apply, because a failed read proves
 *   nothing about where the stored ordinals sit.
 * - Stored ordinals behind the branch numbering (`behind`) cannot be expressed
 *   as empty slots. Readers keep plain branch numbering, as they always have,
 *   and the condition is logged.
 * - Every change of the result is logged once, with the numbers.
